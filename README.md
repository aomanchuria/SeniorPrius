A script to log prius data from OBD port. Tested using a Bluetooth dongle in a Prius C 2014. Notice that this prius only has 10 modules. So you will have to develop something for the larger prii. But this can help you tremendously.

I'm using a "Bafx Products - Wireless Bluetooth OBD2 Scanner & Code Reader" but if you used Dr. Prius on your phone with another reader, that should work
This script can be run on a Raspberrypi Zero. It seems to keep up just fine. Initially I was after just loging the battery voltages, but it seems that many other parts are possible. An excel file is attached, which I have added some more information to from the original. I may complete all the PIDS one day, but the really crucial steps are already done so you can get whatever you want with a little bit of modification.
